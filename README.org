This contains my demonstration on Literate Devops that I gave at
EmacsConf 2015.

I believe what most people, who view [[http://youtu.be/dljNabciEGg][the online video]] are most
interested in, is the =sprint-fuzzy-bunny.org= file that I created
during the demonstration.

If you are interested in how I typed so fast, grab =demo-it= from
MELPA, and try running the =literate-devops-demo.el= script. YMMV.
